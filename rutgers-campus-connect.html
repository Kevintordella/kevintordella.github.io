            <p class="body-text">
                Rutgers University currently lacks a unified, digital community hub that effectively fosters 
                deep student engagement and meaningful collaboration across the university system. This absence 
                impedes students' ability to easily build social and academic bridges and establish safe, 
                inclusive spaces, thereby restricting open communication and the exchange of diverse perspectives 
                crucial for a cohesive campus environment.

            <h4 class="subsection-title-bold">Early Exploration</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
                My goal was to design a digital platform that helps Rutgers students connect, collaborate, and engage 
                more meaningfully. Initial brainstorming focused on unifying fragmented systems into a single hub. 
                Early concepts like peer matchmaking and AI-driven recommendations were explored, but interviews showed 
                students prioritized clarity, not another social network.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsection-title-bold">Refining the Concept</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
                I shifted focus toward three essential engagement pathways to simplify the design:
            </p>
            <ul class="body-list">
                <li><strong>Discover:</strong> Easily explore events and clubs through categories and hashtags</li>
                <li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Use maps to find nearby events in real time</li>
                <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Sync with a personalized calendar for streamlined scheduling</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body-text">
                Feedback highlighted the importance of organization, visual discovery, and quick interaction, 
                leading to a minimalist structure.

            <p class="body-text">
                Peer critiques led to refinement; for instance, the "Scarlet AI" assistant evolved from a chatbot 
                into a smart search companion that personalizes discovery without dominating the interface. This 
                helped establish the final foundation for Campus Connect, making finding belonging as seamless as 
                checking your calendar.

            <p class="body-text">
                The main goal was to create a centralized experience where the home screen acted as the nucleus—a 
                single point for discovering clubs and events. I balanced information density with clarity in early 
                wireframes, ensuring students could reach their goals in three taps or fewer.

                The Campus Connect brand is built around inclusivity and discovery. The app's companion feature,
